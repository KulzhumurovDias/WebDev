</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Prepare outdoor grill for direct grilling over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper; spray both sides with cooking spray. Place chicken on hot grill rack; cover and cook 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken loses its pink color throughout and internal temperature reaches 165°, turning 2 or 3 times during cooking. Transfer chicken to cutting board and loosely cover with aluminum foil; let stand 5 minutes. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, spray all sides of lettuce and cut sides of rolls with cooking spray. Place lettuce and rolls, cut side down, on hot grill rack. Cover and cook lettuce 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly charred and tender-crisp, turning once during cooking; cook rolls 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Chop lettuce into 1-inch pieces. </li>
            <li> In large bowl, toss tomato, dressing, cheese, lettuce, and remaining ¼ teaspoon each salt
and pepper. Place chicken on bottom halves of rolls; evenly top with salad and close sandwiches to serve. </li>

        <p><strong>Steps :</strong> Do something.
</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Chop together anchovy fillets, garlic, and pinch of salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in Parmesan. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. </li>
            <li> Make your own. Tearing, not cutting the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Preheat oven to 375°. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes. </li>
            <li> Caesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts. Skip the tongs. Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing, then top off with the shaved Parm. </li>
